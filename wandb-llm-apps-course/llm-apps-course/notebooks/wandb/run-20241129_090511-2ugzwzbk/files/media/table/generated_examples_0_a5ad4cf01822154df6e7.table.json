This approach allows each individual model being trained by the Run to correspond to its own Model Artifact and each checkpoint is a Model Version.

You'd usually create a Registered Model for each use case or modeling task and use aliases like \"production\" or \"staging\" to mark versions with special purposes.\n\nRemember that a Model Artifact belongs to only one Model Version but may belong to zero or more Registered Models.

These are typically the files produced from the serialization process provided by your modeling library, such as PyTorch or Keras.\n\n- **Model Artifact**: A Model Artifact is essentially a sequence of Model Versions. It can alias specific versions which allows downstream consumers to pin to such aliases. This makes it incredibly useful for maintaining many versions of a model while training, typically saving checkpoints periodically. Each checkpoint corresponds to a separate Model Version of the respective Model Artifact.\n\n- **Registered Model**: This behaves more like a folder of bookmarks, which are sets of links to Model Versions.

You will typically create a Registered Model for each of your use cases or modeling tasks and use aliases like \"production\" or \"staging\" to denote versions with special purposes. \n\nSo in summary, Model Version is the smallest unit, comprising specific sets of files.

Initialize a W&B Run with `wandb.init()`. This will establish a new run for your model.\n\n```python\nrun = wandb.init(project=\"table-test\")\n```\n\n2. Create a `wandb.Table()` instance and pass your DataFrame to it. \n\n```python\nmy_table = wandb.Table(dataframe=your_dataframe)\n```\n\nPlease ensure to replace 'your_dataframe' with your DataFrame's name.\n\n3. Log the table with `run.log()` as a key-value pair. Provide a name for your table for the key and pass the object instance of `wandb.Table` as the value.\n\n```python\nrun.log({\"Your Table Name\": my_table})\n```\n\nRemember to replace 'Your Table Name' with a name for your table.\n\nAfter these steps, you can view your table in the W&B workspace. To do this, navigate to the W&B app and select the name of your run in your project workspace. You will see a new panel added for each unique table key. In this case, 'Your Table Name'.\n"], ["\nThe user has created a model and is now trying to log data tables for this model.

Start a W&B run with the `wandb.init()` command.\n2. Create a `wandb.Table()` object instance. You can pass in the name of your table columns and the data for these columns.\n3. Log your table with the `run.log()` command, where the key is the name of your table and the value is the `wandb.Table` object instance.\n\nHere's an example in Python:\n\n```python\nrun = wandb.init(project=\"table-test\")\nmy_table = wandb.Table(columns=[\"a\", \"b\"], data=[[\"a1\", \"b1\"], [\"a2\", \"b2\"]])\nrun.log({\"Table Name\": my_table})\n```\n\nYes, you can use a Pandas DataFrame instead of manually creating a data array for the `wandb.Table()` function. For further details, you can take a look at the `wandb.Table` section in the W&B API Reference Guide.\n\nLogging tables is a powerful way to compare results from different model versions. If you log sample tables from multiple W&B runs, you can view and compare them in your project workspace. The table filter, sort, and grouping features allow you to analyze results efficiently.
